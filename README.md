# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch. This supervised classification project was carried out as part of the IBM Data Science Professional certificate.

# Presentation of the project
The presentation covers all steps described in Jupyter Notebooks in following sections. From Data Collection, Analysis to prediction of launch succeess (succesful first stage landing) with classification algorithms. We draw a parallel between SpaceX Falcon9 and ArianeEspace Ariane5 (and coming Ariane6) that was dominating the market of commercial launches until SpaceX put an end to this domination thanks to the reusable boosters concept and induced cost reduction.
